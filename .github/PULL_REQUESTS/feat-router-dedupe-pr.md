Title: feat: add router dedupe with hash registry and backfill

Description:

This PR adds an exact-content dedupe guard to the NAVI router and the tooling to support it.

What’s included
- tools/file_hash.js — streaming SHA‑256 utility (computeFileHash)
- tools/seen_files.js — append-only registry utilities for NAVI/metadata/seen_files.jsonl
- router integration (`runtime/current/router.js`) — computes file hash at discovery, checks registry, marks sidecars with `routing.duplicate` and `routing.duplicate_of`, and honors `dedupe` config policy (flag|skip|tag)
- scripts/backfill_seen_files.js — idempotent backfill script to populate `seen_files.jsonl` from `NAVI/inbox` and `NAVI/sorted` (supports `--dry-run`)
- tests:
  - `runtime/current/test/router_dedupe.spec.js` (integration tests for duplicate detection, skip and tag policies)
  - `runtime/current/test/backfill.spec.js` (verifies backfill behavior)
  - `runtime/current/test/file_hash.spec.js` and `runtime/current/test/seen_files.spec.js`
- docs: `NAVI/docs/dedupe.md` — config options, rollout steps, and notes

How to test
1. Run unit & integration tests in `runtime/current`:
   - `cd runtime/current && npm test -- test/router_dedupe.spec.js test/backfill.spec.js` (all pass locally)
2. Dry-run router to observe sidecars for duplicates:
   - `node runtime/current/router.js --dry-run` (or set `NAVI_ROOT` to a test NAVI root)
3. Use backfill script in dry-run mode to preview entries:
   - `node scripts/backfill_seen_files.js --dry-run --navi-root <path>`

Configuration
Add the `dedupe` block to `NAVI/config/routing_config.json` (defaults shown):

```json
{
  "dedupe": { "enabled": true, "policy": "flag" }
}
```

Notes
- Default policy `flag` marks duplicates but preserves routing behavior.
- `skip` will prevent routing of duplicates (route set to `mail_room.duplicate_skipped`).
- This PR implements exact-hash dedupe only (Phase 2 fuzzy dedupe may be added later).

How to roll out
- See `NAVI/docs/dedupe.md` for staged rollout guidance (Stage 0 flag-only → Stage 1 backfill → Stage 2 policy change).

### Reviewer checklist
- [ ] Skim `NAVI/docs/dedupe.md` (Rollout + Quick Checks).
- [ ] Verify router dedupe tests pass (`runtime/current/test/router_dedupe.spec.js`).
- [ ] Verify backfill tests pass (`runtime/current/test/backfill.spec.js`).
- [ ] Sanity-check `scripts/backfill_seen_files.js` flags (`--dry-run`, `--limit`, `--navi-root`).

If you want, I can create the PR on GitHub now — the branch has been pushed to `origin/feat/router-dedupe`.
