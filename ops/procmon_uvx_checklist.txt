ProcMon Capture Checklist (minimal)

1) Launch ProcMon as Administrator
   - Procmon.exe (Sysinternals)
   - Ctrl+E -> Stop capture immediately
   - Ctrl+X -> Clear existing events

2) Filters (open Filter...)
   - Include: Operation    is    Process Create
   - Include: Process Name is    uvx.exe
   - Include: Process Name is    uvx.cmd
   - Include: Process Name is    node.exe
   - Exclude: everything else (add a broad Exclude for noise if you need)

3) Capture Window
   - Ctrl+E -> Start capture
   - Reproduce the scenario (restart service or run the workflow that spawns uvx)
   - Wait ~5-10 seconds
   - Ctrl+E -> Stop capture

4) Save
   - File -> Save
   - Format: CSV (or Native PML if you prefer; CSV easier for script parsing)
   - Suggested name: uvx-parent-trace-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.csv

5) After capture
   - Run the correlation script:
       .\ops\correlate_procmon_with_uvx.ps1 -ProcmonCsv 'path\to\uvx-parent-trace.csv' -UvXLog 'logs\\uvx-shim.log' -TraceLog 'logs\\uvx-parent-trace.log' -OutFile 'ops\\uvx-correlated.jsonl'
   - Share the generated `ops/uvx-correlated.jsonl` (or the CSV + PML) if you want me to analyze further.

Safety notes:
 - Keep the capture window small.
 - Export CSV rather than sending full PML if you need to share output; CSV is smaller and contains needed fields.
