# VBOARDER — System Intent & Operating Canon

> Canon update: top-level docs moved to `docs/`. Root should be navigation-only.

> **READ MODE — CANONICAL DOCUMENT**
>
> This file defines what VBoarder *is*, what it *is not*, and how work flows through the system.
> No feature, folder, script, or automation may contradict this document.

## 1. What VBoarder Is

VBoarder is the **Chief-of-Staff (CoS) layer** for a human + AI organization.

Its purpose is to:

* Collect *all* incoming work, information, and signals
* Clarify what each item *is*
* Route items to the correct AI or human partner
* Maintain trust in system state and progress

VBoarder **does not execute work**.
VBoarder **does not make departmental strategy**.
VBoarder **does not replace human judgment**.

It orchestrates.

## 2. Core Actors (Authority Layers)

### 2.1 Human + AI Partner (Primary Owner)

* The human and their primary AI partner form the decision core
* They set intent, priorities, and final judgment

### 2.2 Chief of Staff (VBoarder)

* Enforces intake discipline
* Prevents work from bypassing clarification
* Guarantees routing integrity

### 2.3 AIR — Knowledge Authority

* Collects, scrapes, normalizes, and summarizes information
* Maintains memory, context, and references
* **AIR does not decide or prioritize**

### 2.4 Department AI Partners (Future)

Examples:

* CFO (Finance)
* CTO (Technology)
* Marketing
* Sales
* Legal
* Personal / Life Ops

These are **clients of VBoarder**, not peers.

---

## 3. GTD Usage (Strict Scope)

GTD is used **only** as a workflow control system.

It governs:

* Intake
* Clarification
* State transitions
* Trust boundaries

GTD is **not** used for:

* Strategy
* Reasoning
* Creativity
* Decision-making

---

## 4. Canonical Work States

Every item in the system must exist in **exactly one** state.

1. **Collected** — captured, not understood
2. **Clarified** — identified and classified
3. **Routed** — assigned to a responsible party
4. **Executing** — actively being worked
5. **Closed** — complete or archived

No item may skip a state.

---

## 5. Intake Rule (Single Entry Point)

All inputs enter through **NAVI/inbox**.

Sources include:

* Files
* Notes
* Ideas
* Emails
* Logs
* Human thoughts

If it did not enter through the inbox, it is **out of system**.

---

## 6. NAVI Responsibilities

NAVI is the **state machine** for work items.

It:

* Detects new inputs
* Creates a work item record
* Moves items between states
* Never decides priority or meaning

---

## 7. Presenter (View Layer)

The presenter:

* Renders system state for humans
* Is **not** a source of truth
* Must reflect canonical state only

HTML output is a *window*, not the engine.

---

## 8. Explicit Non-Goals

VBoarder does **not**:

* Execute tasks
* Replace departments
* Store raw data long-term
* Make autonomous decisions
* Grow features without intent review

---

## 9. READ MODE RULES

While in READ MODE:

* No new folders
* No new automations
* No new routes
* No refactors

Only:

* Observation
* Documentation
* Clarification

---

## 10. Prime Directive

> **If the system becomes confusing, stop and return to this file.**

Structure follows intent.
Intent is documented here.
